            <p>My name is Victor Martins, I write for Meio Bit Games and here I will tell you a little about my experiences as a gamer. The idea is for the blog to be a more casual place where I will write about how I divide my life between games and normal day-to-day activities. I will rarely comment on any news here, as this is not the focus of the blog.

                At the moment I own a PS3 and a PS2, a Game Cube, a PSP, a Wii and an Xbox 360, in addition to playing on pc.

                If you want to know the backstage of the life of a gamer who has been in this area for more than twenty years and who started playing games even before learning to read, I invite you to visit Vida de Gamer.</p>
